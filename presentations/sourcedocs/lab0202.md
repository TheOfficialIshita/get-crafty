## Lab goals 02/02/2016

Get to know the compact `git`/GitHub workflow

~~~

```
# Pick a good spot.

$ cd path/to/your/directory

# From the cloud to your laptop, you're welcome.

$ git clone jueyang/get-crafty

# Something appeared as if magical

$ ls

# Local changes ensue!

$ cd get-crafty
```

~~~

Your default branch is called `master`.

```
# Create a branch called `mybio`, go there.

$ git checkout -b mybio

# To check which branch you are on (find the asterisk)

$ git branch

```

~~~

```
# Open the file

$ subl index.html

# OR open the whole project (useful when you have bigger projects)

$ subl .
```

Next, you will:

- Edit `index.html` by adding a `<div>` with `class='person' id='yourfullname'`

- In between the `<div>`, add your name, concentration, and a random fact about your self.

~~~

Staging and committing

```
# Check the difference

$ git status

# Stage your changes

$ git add -p

# Commit them

$ git commit -m 'add new files'

# Check again, what happened?

$ git status

```

~~~

Contributing to the common good

```
# fork the upstream remote

$ git fork

# push to your fork

$ git push YOUR_USERNAME mybio

# send a pull request to the upstream remote

$ git pull-request "YOUR_USERNAME added the bio"
```

~~~

Send a screenshot when you run into a problem!

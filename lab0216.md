## The DOM is...

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** provides a structured representation of the document.

It defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the

- document structure
- style
- content

The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.

### Understanding structure/node exercise

[here](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Qyorqv?editors=1011)

## JS 101

Create a new [codepen](http://codepen.io).

### Data types

- string
- number
- boolean

**Review**: Define three varibles of each type respectively. Then check with

`typeof(varible)`

### console.log

`console.log('please tell me the secret of life')`

## Arrays

```
var mags = ['The New Yorker','Nautilus','N+1'];

console.log(mags);
console.log(mags.length);
console.log(mags.length(0));
```

### Push

```
mags.push('Bon Appetit');

console.log(mags);
```

### Loop

```
mags.forEach(function(oneMag){
	console.log('I read ' + oneMag);
});
```

*= There are quite a few methods for looping an array. See supplement reading.

### Map

```
var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
var doubles = numbers.map(function(oneNumber,iterator){
	return oneNumber * 2;	
});

console.log(doubles)
```

### Join

```
var words = ['what','a','wonderful','life'];

words.join();
words.join('');
words.join(' ');

console.log(words);
```

### Push

```
words.push('amirite');

console.log(words);
```

### Slice

```
partial = words.slice(1,4);

console.log(partial)
```

### Objects

```
var favMag = {};

favMag.name = 'Nautilus';
favMag.genre = 'science';
favMag.interns = ['JoAnna Klein','Susie Neilson','Ankur Paliwal']
favMag.notinterns= [
	{"name":"John Steele", "role":"Publisher and Editorial Director"},
	{"name":"Michael Segal", "role":"Editor in Chief"},
	{"name":"Meehan Crist", "role":"Editor-at-Large"},
]

console.log(favMag);
console.log(favMag.interns);
```

### Functions

```
function addTwoNumbers(num1,num2){
	return num1 + numb2
}

addNumbers(3,4)
```

#### Callback

passing one function into another

```
function addPumpkinsAfterCalculation(num1,num2,calculation){
	return calculation + ' pumpkins'
}

addPumpkinsAfterCalculation(4, 5, addTwoNumbers)
```

## Homework

### A primer on branching

Create a new branch and go to there:

`git checkout -b refactor`

Check which branch you're on:

`git branch`

When pushing:

`git push origin refactor`

Refactor your `js` files from homework 1.

Goal:

- Write four calculating functions.
- Complete a fifth function that populates the html with a sentence describing the calculation. _Unlike the previous homework, you are no longer constrained by the two varibles you defined. With this function, you can create content with any combinations of two numbers._
- Excecute the function once for each type of calculation.

How:

Read the instructions in [this semi-finished `js` file](https://gist.github.com/jueyang/c2190c014421de494e0b) and complete it. It walks you through re-writing your javascript.

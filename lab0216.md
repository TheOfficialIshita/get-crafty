## Lab goal

- Clarify DOM and its relationship with Javascript.
- Javascript 101.

## The DOM is...

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** provides a structured representation of the document.

It defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the

- document structure
- style
- content

The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.

### Can you show me the structure?

[Sure can](https://jueyang.github.io/get-crafty/illustrate.html).

### Can I create it by myself?

[Yes, and you should](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Qyorqv?editors=1011).

## JS 101

Continue using [codepen](http://codepen.io).

### Data types

- string
- number
- boolean

**Review**: Define three varibles of each type respectively. Then check with `typeof(varible)`.

See all data types [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures).

### console.log

`console.log('please tell me the secret of life')`

### ☞ Array

```
var mags = ['The New Yorker','Nautilus','N+1'];

console.log(mags);
console.log(mags.length);
console.log(mags.length(0));
```

#### push

```
mags.push('Bon Appetit');

console.log(mags);
```

#### forEach

```
mags.forEach(function(oneMag){
	console.log('I read ' + oneMag);
});
```

#### map

```
var numbers = [22,46,72];

var doubles = numbers.map(function(oneNumber){
	return oneNumber * 2;
});

var sentences = numbers.map(function(oneNumber, index){
	return oneNumber + ' has an index of ' + index	+ ' in this array.'
});

console.log(doubles);
console.log(sentences);
```

#### join

```
var words = ['what','a','wonderful','life'];

words.join();
words.join('');
words.join(' ');

console.log(words);
```

#### slice

```
partial = words.slice(1,3);

console.log(partial);
```

### ☞String

```
var name = 'Barack Obama';

console.log(name.length)
console.log(name[7]);
```

#### substr

```
var firstName = name.substr(0,6);

console.log(firstName);
```

### ☞ Object

```
var favMag = {};

favMag.name = 'Nautilus';
favMag.genre = 'science';
favMag.interns = ['JoAnna Klein','Susie Neilson','Ankur Paliwal']
favMag.notinterns= [
	{"name":"John Steele", "role":"Publisher and Editorial Director"},
	{"name":"Michael Segal", "role":"Editor in Chief"},
	{"name":"Meehan Crist", "role":"Editor-at-Large"},
]

console.log(favMag);
console.log(favMag.interns);
```

### ☞ Function

```
function addTwoNumbers(num1,num2){
	return num1 + numb2
}

addNumbers(3,4);
```

#### callback

Briefly speaking, it's passing one function into another.

```
function addPumpkinsAfterCalculation(num1,num2,calculation){
	return calculation + ' pumpkins'
}

addPumpkinsAfterCalculation(4, 5, addTwoNumbers);
```

## How will I use a loop

1.[I got an exercise for you](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/obVdxJ?editors=1010)
2. [for Loop](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yewwzY?editors=1012)

## Homework

Refactor your `js` files from homework 1. **Due by noon, Feb 22.**

### Goal

- Write four calculating functions.
- Complete a fifth function that populates the html with a sentence describing the calculation. You've already done it - "when I add x and y I get z". But Unlike the previous homework, you are no longer constrained by the two varibles you defined. With this function, you can create content with combinations of ANY two numbers.
- Excecute the function once per type of calculation.

### How

Read the instructions in [this semi-finished `js` file](https://gist.github.com/jueyang/62324823e479839d491f) and complete it. It walks you through re-writing your javascript.

### Branch it off

**So far you have been on one branch, `master`. You are going to work in a new branch because it lets you keep your original (working) version, while experimenting on a new one.

Create a new branch called `refactor`. 

`git checkout -b refactor`

Check which branch you're on before you start working and before you push:

`git branch`

Push to a remote (new) branch

`git push origin refactor`
